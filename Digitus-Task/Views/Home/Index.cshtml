        Your are requested to design and implement user login and authentication feature for an
        Internet facing web application. In addition to standard login, the users should be able to
        register to the site using their name, surname, email and password. After entering these
        information, a verification email should be sent to the user, containing the activation
        code. Users are not allowed to login without entering their verification code after
        registration. Also, there must be a mechanism for users to retrieve their passwords in case
        they lose their passwords
